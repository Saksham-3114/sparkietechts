In the end, simply what Yasin Tarabia wears, although I would be happy with a significantly watered-down version. \nWith AskOkey having so much success on Instagram and so many menswear influencers making the drape cut popular again, I thought it couldn't be impossible to find something remotely comparable from mainstream brands like Boss or Suitsupply, but so far I'm stumped. When the jackets are finally cut a little wider and straighter, the pants are usually so fashionably baggy with a low crotch and heavy taper that it looks terrible and makes the wearer look shapeless. However, if the pants have a more formal cut (e.g. wide leg at Suitsupply, even if they are still too tight for my taste), the jackets are usually too tight again. \nI am a student and in my field I hardly ever go to events with a dress code that goes beyond business casual, so I need the suit more for social events such as weddings, which is why I’d definitely choose a good cut over luxurious materials. Budget would be up to 700€, I live in Munich and am 187 cm tall and weigh 77 kg. \nIs there really no option, or can anyone think of anything? \nThank you!",
